# Colleagues of Legends

This microproject page was born from an idea for our growing company:
 can we help our colleagues know each other a little better?

We asked them to "score" how much they are familiar with other colleagues
 (0 = never met; 5 = working together on a daily basis / childhood friends / ...)

We needed a tool to effectively use the data we gathered,
 so this page parses the CSV version of the data and
 suggests groupings of people that don't know each other very much.

The goal is having a starting point for making groups
 for social and team building activities, shaking up a bit the old cliques and
 letting everyone discover something new about someone.
